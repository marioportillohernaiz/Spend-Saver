# Spender Saver

<p>The following repository contains a money management app. This simple and efficient app lets you add your weekly or once-in-a-while groceries in group names. For example, buying "chicken" and "minced meat" will be added to a "Meats" group, whereas buying "lettuce" or "asparagus" will be added to a "Vegetables" group. The app contains predefined groups in which you can later on add to them and create your own.</p>
<p>The app creates good visuals to represent all the data you add to it. Your home page will contain a pie chart with the monthly expenses, in addition, you can open the overall screen to view your all-time expenses on a bar chart split by each year/month. This simple app also contains an account page where you can view your account details, a user guide and more.</p>
